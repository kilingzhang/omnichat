# Ignore deprecated warning for request package (transitive dependency of node-telegram-bot-api)
# The request package is deprecated and has no patch. This is a known issue with
# node-telegram-bot-api which uses @cypress/request-promise -> request-promise-core -> request
# This will be resolved when node-telegram-bot-api migrates away from request or when
# we switch to a modern alternative like grammY
